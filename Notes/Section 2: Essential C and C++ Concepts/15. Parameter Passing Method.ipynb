    "# What is Parameter? Name the types. \n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "There are three types:\n",
    "* Pass by value\n",
    "* Pass by address\n",
    "* Pass by reference     // Only in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Take below example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void swap(int x, int y){\n",
    "    int temp;\n",
    "    temp = x;\n",
    "    x = y;\n",
    "    y = temp;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "int main(){\n",
    "    int x, y;\n",
    "    x = 10;\n",
    "    y = 5;\n",
    "    printf(\"Value of x is %d and value of y is %d\", x, y);\n",
    "    z = swap(x, y);\n",
    "    printf(\"Value of x is %d and value of y is %d\", x, y);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, values in the main section of the code did not get affected by the function because the function had created its own instance of variable whose value was locally assigned. This is example of pass by value. Pass by value is usually used in times where we have a return value from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass value as address, we'll use below logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void swap(int *x, int *y){\n",
    "    int temp;\n",
    "    temp = *x;\n",

    "    int x, y;\n",
    "    x = 10;\n",
    "    y = 5;\n",

    "    z = swap(&x, &y);\n",
    "    printf(\"Value of x is %d and value of y is %d\", x, y);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the function has indirect access to values in main(). Here, the function creates memory instance to store **address** of the variable from main.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert pass by value to pass by reference, we change code as \n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
